# ktjs-echarts

Kotlin/JS wrappers for the [`echarts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/echarts) ecosystem.

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**[Live demo](https://shijianjs.github.io/ktjs-echarts/)** ·
**[API reference](https://shijianjs.github.io/ktjs-echarts/api/)**

The repository keeps one Gradle module per npm package, or per group of packages that share an
upstream version and release cadence. The project's namesake package owns the `ktjs-echarts`
module; additional modules use the `ktjs-echarts-*` prefix. Tree shaking removes unused
declarations from the final application bundle, so grouping related packages into one module is
cheaper than one module per package.

## Modules

| Module | npm package | Wrapper version | Maven Central |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ktjs-echarts](ktjs-echarts/README.md) | `echarts` | `6.1.0-kt.1` | [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.shijianjs/ktjs-echarts?label=Maven%20Central&logo=apachemaven&logoColor=white)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.shijianjs/ktjs-echarts) |
| [ktjs-echarts-gl](ktjs-echarts-gl/README.md) | `echarts-gl` | `2.1.0-kt.1` | [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.shijianjs/ktjs-echarts-gl?label=Maven%20Central&logo=apachemaven&logoColor=white)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.shijianjs/ktjs-echarts-gl) |

## Versioning

Each module is versioned as `{upstream npm version}-kt.{revision}`. The upstream npm versions are
declared once in the root [`package.json`](package.json); the revision is read per module from
[`wrapper-revisions.properties`](wrapper-revisions.properties). Gradle derives the base version and
the `npm(...)` dependency from these two files:

- Only `-kt.N` versions are published; a version without the suffix never exists.
- Upstream upgrade: change the version in `package.json`; the base version follows automatically
  while the revision stays, even when the wrapper code itself did not change.
- Wrapper-only fix: the revision increments (`kt.2`, `kt.3`, ...) while the base version stays.
- Revisions are tracked per module and only ever increase; they never reset to `kt.1`. A release
  bumps and publishes only the modules that changed.

## Requirements

- JDK 17 or newer (the build uses Gradle 9.4.1).
- Node.js is downloaded automatically by the Kotlin Gradle plugin. npm is used because Yarn is
  disabled in `gradle.properties`.
- Chromium is downloaded by Playwright the first time browser tests run.
- The demo's end-to-end test is a Playwright JUnit 5 suite that drives the bundled page, so `node`
  must also be on `PATH`.

## Build and test

```bash
./gradlew build

# Per-module tests
./gradlew :ktjs-echarts:jsBrowserTest

# End-to-end checks for the bundled demo page (Playwright, needs node on PATH)
./gradlew :demo:e2eTest

# GitHub Pages site (demo at the root, Dokka output under /api/)
./gradlew pagesSite
```

After adding or upgrading an npm dependency in a module, refresh the shared lock file:

```bash
./gradlew kotlinUpgradePackageLock
```

## Installation

Releases are published to Maven Central under the `io.github.shijianjs` group. Replace the version
with the one you need (`{upstream version}-kt.{revision}`):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.shijianjs:ktjs-echarts:6.1.0-kt.1")
}
```

The POMs point at this GitHub repository (`url` and `scm.url`), and every module is a Kotlin
Multiplatform project publishing `kotlin-tooling-metadata.json`. Those are the requirements for
[klibs.io](https://klibs.io/) to discover the libraries automatically.

## Publishing

Publishing is configured once in the root [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts) for all modules.
Releases run through `.github/workflows/release.yml`: it signs the artifacts, packages one archive
per Maven coordinate and registers them with the shared Maven Central hub. The hub later merges the
pending registrations into a single Central deployment. See the publishing section in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the one-time setup.
